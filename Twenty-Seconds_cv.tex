    {Sample availability is a major bottleneck in research on meiosis. I developed an automated tissue extraction procedure which increases extraction efficiency 10 fold and thus dramatically increases sample availability.}

%{A major challenge for research on meiotic cells in fruitflies is the fact that few cells of interest exist in each fly and that these cells are extracted by time-consuming hand-dissection. To overcome this problem I developed a semi-automated procedure which increases extraction efficiency 10 fold. Using this procedure it becomes possible to study meiosis in fruit flies using approches classically known to require high input sample amounts.}

\section{other information}
Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a “poky little house,” and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
